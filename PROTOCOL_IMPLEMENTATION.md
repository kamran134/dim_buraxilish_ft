# Protocol Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Implemented complete protocol functionality for the mobile Flutter application based on the existing Angular web implementation. The feature follows the pattern where "мониторы добавляют, админы читают" (monitors add, admins read).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Data Models (`lib/models/protocol_models.dart`)
- `ProtocolNote` - Main protocol note entity with all fields
- `NoteType` - Protocol note type classification
- `CreateProtocolNoteRequest` - Request model for creating new protocol notes
- `UpdateProtocolNoteRequest` - Request model for updating existing protocol notes
- Response wrapper models with pagination support

### 2. API Service (`lib/services/protocol_service.dart`)
Complete API integration with backend endpoints:
- `getNoteTypes()` - Fetch available note types
- `getMyProtocolNotes()` - Get monitor's protocol notes for current exam
- `createProtocolNote()` - Create new protocol note during exam
- `updateProtocolNote()` - Update existing protocol note
- `getProtocols()` - Get all protocols with filtering (admin function)

### 3. Enhanced Date Utilities (`lib/utils/date_formatter.dart`)
Added Azerbaijani date parsing support:
- `parseAzerbaijaniDate()` - Parse "10 oktyabr 2025-ci il" format
- `azerbaijaniDateToISO()` - Convert Azerbaijani date to ISO format
- `formatISOToAz()` - Convert ISO date to Azerbaijani format
- Month mapping for Azerbaijani language

### 4. Monitor Interface (`lib/screens/protocol_notes_screen.dart`)
Full-featured screen for monitors to manage protocol notes:
- View list of protocol notes for current exam
- Add new protocol notes with form validation
- Edit existing protocol notes
- Real-time updates and error handling
- Responsive Material Design UI with custom styling
- Integration with AuthProvider for exam date context

### 5. Admin Interface (`lib/screens/protocol_reports_screen.dart`)
Comprehensive admin screen for viewing and filtering protocols:
- Advanced filtering by building number, exam date, date ranges
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Export preparation (Excel export placeholder)
- Clean and intuitive Material Design interface
- Real-time search and filtering
- Detailed protocol information display

### 6. Navigation Integration
Added protocol access to both bottom navigation and side menu:

#### Bottom Navigation (both participant_screen.dart and supervisor_screen.dart):
- New "Protokollar" tab with role-based routing
- Monitors → Protocol Notes Screen (adding/editing)
- Admins → Protocol Reports Screen (viewing/filtering)

#### Side Menu (monitor_drawer.dart):
- "Protokol qeydləri" - Direct access to monitor notes interface
- "Protokol hesabatları" - Direct access to admin reports interface

## Role-Based Access Control
The implementation respects user roles through AuthProvider:
- **Monitors (`monitor` role)**: Can add and edit protocol notes for their exam
- **Admins/Super-admins**: Can view and filter all protocol notes across exams
- Navigation automatically routes users to appropriate screens based on their role

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Patterns
- Service layer pattern for API communication
- Provider pattern for state management
- Repository-like structure with HttpService integration
- Consistent error handling and user feedback

### UI/UX Consistency
- Follows existing app design patterns and color scheme
- Uses established common widgets (GradientBackground, ScreenHeader, AnimatedWrapper)
- Maintains consistent typography and spacing
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Data Handling
- Proper null safety throughout the implementation
- JSON serialization without external dependencies
- Efficient state management with loading states
- Form validation and user input sanitization

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `lib/models/protocol_models.dart` - Protocol data models
- `lib/services/protocol_service.dart` - Protocol API service
- `lib/screens/protocol_notes_screen.dart` - Monitor interface
- `lib/screens/protocol_reports_screen.dart` - Admin interface

### Modified Files:
- `lib/utils/date_formatter.dart` - Enhanced with Azerbaijani date support
- `lib/widgets/monitor_drawer.dart` - Added protocol menu items
- `lib/screens/supervisor_screen.dart` - Added protocol navigation
- `lib/screens/participant_screen.dart` - Added protocol navigation

## Usage Instructions

### For Monitors:
1. Navigate to "Protokollar" from bottom navigation or "Protokol qeydləri" from side menu
2. View existing protocol notes for current exam
3. Tap "+" button to add new protocol note
4. Fill in note type and description, submit
5. Edit existing notes by tapping on them

### For Admins:
1. Navigate to "Protokollar" from bottom navigation or "Protokol hesabatları" from side menu
2. Use filter panel to search by building, exam date, or date range
3. View detailed protocol information
4. Export functionality available (placeholder for Excel export)

## Integration Notes
- Seamlessly integrated with existing authentication and role management system
- Uses established HTTP client with JWT token handling
- Consistent with existing app navigation patterns
- Follows Flutter best practices and material design guidelines
- All text in Azerbaijani language for consistency with the app

## Future Enhancements
- Excel export functionality implementation
- Push notifications for new protocol notes
- Offline protocol note drafts with sync
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Protocol note attachments and photos
